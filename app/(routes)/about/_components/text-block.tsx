          Hey there, I'm Sanem, a design enthusiast with a journey that spans 4+ years working for agencies and as a
          freelancer. During this time, I have honed my skills in design principles, user experience, and creative
          direction. I'm proficient in design tools such as Adobe Creative Suite and Figma, and have a basic
          understanding of front-end development languages like HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been passionate about design since I was young and have pursued it by working on various projects for
          different clients. I've had the opportunity to collaborate with startups and businesses, creating user
          interfaces for websites, software applications, and mobile apps.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a designer, my main focus is on creating user-friendly interfaces. I also work alongside a team of
          copywriters, designers, and project managers. I believe in keeping the user at the center of the design, and I
          work closely with clients to understand their users' needs, conduct research, and develop wireframes and
          prototypes to ensure the final design meets both user and business goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, I love painting, making music, and further pursuing my creative side ðŸŽ¨. Apart from that, I
          enjoy spending my time hiking in the backcountry and going off on wild adventures.
